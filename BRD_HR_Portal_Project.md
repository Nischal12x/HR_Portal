The HR Portal project aims to develop a comprehensive web-based platform to streamline and automate human resource management processes for BISP Infonet Pvt. Ltd. This portal will facilitate employee management, leave tracking, project and task management, timesheet recording, and employee handbook distribution. The solution will improve operational efficiency, reduce manual errors, and provide real-time insights into HR activities.

- Enable project and task management with role-based access and team collaboration.  
- Facilitate timesheet submission and tracking for accurate work hour recording.

## 3. Vision  
To create an integrated, user-friendly HR Portal that empowers employees and HR personnel with efficient tools for managing human resources, fostering transparency, and supporting organizational growth.

---

## 4. Scope  
The HR Portal will cover the following functional areas:  
- Employee Management: Registration, updates, role assignments, and history tracking.  
- Leave Management: Leave types, applications, approvals, and leave balance calculations.  
- Project & Task Management: Project creation, team assignments, task tracking, and status updates.  
- Timesheet Management: Daily and weekly timesheet submissions, image timesheets, and approvals.  
- Employee Handbook: Upload, distribution, and acknowledgement tracking.  
- Authentication & Authorization: Role-based access control for HR, Project Leaders, and Employees.  
- Reporting & Dashboards: Summary views of employees, projects, leaves, tasks, and timesheets.  

---

## 5. Current Process  
Currently, HR processes are managed manually or through disparate systems leading to inefficiencies, delayed approvals, and lack of centralized data. Leave applications and approvals are paper-based or email-driven, causing tracking difficulties. Project and timesheet management lack integration with HR data.

---

## 6. Proposed Process  
The HR Portal will automate and centralize HR functions, providing a single platform for all stakeholders. Employees can apply for leave online, track their balances, and submit timesheets. HR can manage employee records, approve leaves, and monitor projects and tasks. Project Leaders can assign tasks and track progress. The portal will generate reports and dashboards for informed decision-making.
